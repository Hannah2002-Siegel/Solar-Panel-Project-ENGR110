# Solar-Panel-Project-ENGR110
In this project a group of students was tasked with designing and experiment (DOE) in order to explore the capabilities and optimal implementation of a 2 PV solar panel scheme and what loads could be energized from the system. My role in the project was designing the DOE as well as analyzing all data collected during trials.
